Earlier this morning, I wrote a post about how my Discord account got disabled over a simple joke saying I was negative 6 years old. A couple hours later, I actually did finally get a response. However, I cannot decide whether this is shocking because of the incompetence, or unsurprising because what else would this company do but this.

## Their response:

## My response:
Effective immediately, all services to DankRPG have been shut down. I am not dealing with this company anymore. You can argue many countless things about oh maybe you should have thought better, or oh maybe you shouldn't joke about things like that. I don't care. None of this is my own fault, and it does not take more than an IQ of 5 to realise that. You ruined it and I'm leaving.
