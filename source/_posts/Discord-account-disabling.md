Here's some words from me about an ongoing situation with Discord, its effects on DankRPG, and more broadly Discord's moderation.

# The issue:
My main Discord account, snoozeds, has been indefinitely disabled because: 
**"You've indicated that you're under the age of 13 or the minimum age of digital consent in your country."**

## Is this true?
While I am not under the age of 13 (the minimum required age here in the UK), this phrase is *technically true*. However, this is the funniest and stupidest fucking thing I've ever dealt with.

## What caused this?
A message along the lines of **"I'm actually negative 6 years old"** Yes. **Negative 6**. A negative 6 year old, with great grammatical & technological skills. I should be removed from the platform for this heinous crime. (/s)

From what I can only assume is an automated system (I genuinely hope no human saw this and thought this was a smart decision), my account has been indefinitely disabled. I have, of course, appealed this decision (no response after 4 days), but I will most likely get a copy-paste response asking for ID verification, which even if I had currently, I would not give to Discord, because that is stupid for something that I am clearly not. And for those that also do not know, verifying a Discord bot already requires an ID. DankRPG is a verified Discord bot, and has been since *5th December 2021*.

So, anyways, the future of my 2 year old Discord bot is under jeopardy because of a joke I said during a discussion about the Discord ToS and how weird moderation can be.

# Impact to DankRPG:
I cannot entirely say what will happen to DankRPG in the near future until I get a response from Discord. As of writing this, it has been 4 days. I have currently paused making changes to the bot.

- If I do not get the account back:
I'm done. I'm not playing games or getting around moderation, or any of that. I am done. Development on the bot will stop immediately, with shutdown of websites related to DankRPG. The Github will still remain for those who care, though bugs will remain alongside currently unfinished features.

- In the rare chance I do get the account back:
I will take a break. I do not know how long for, but this has not been great for me. My contributions to this platform, and my Discord bot have ultimately felt worthless and it has not been great thinking about how my years of my hard, unpaid work can be gone over this. I will eventually return, I can promise that much.

# Final words:
It has been clear that Discord has had... not the best moderation for years now. The fact that something as stupid like this can happen on a platform ran by a **BILLION dollar** company says enough.

Think of it this way: potentially **YEARS** of work and content on the platform could be wiped over a joke in one conversation. I should not have to feel like I'm being watched constantly, careful of saying *anything* that could be taken in a wrong way, when just talking to friends in a casual conversation, while time and time again it has been proven that real criminals use this platform, with sometimes little to no consequence. Something needs to change.

This situation has caused me to start blogging, which I thought I would never do. I may make more posts on here, I may not.

### Evidence:

#### #1
The only message that could have caused this to happen is the one below. Now, this does not include the full context, mainly because I did not want to get the server into trouble, but you'll have to believe me here. I was joking. Pretty obviously.

The email I recieved from Discord. Official discord email.
